# libhal-linux
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There is not yet a published package on JFrog and you will need to build the package manually using `conan create . --version=latest`. This will be fixed soon.
> No cross compiler profiles have been created yet, to use develop using this you currently need develop with the same archtecture and operating system as your build target. A Dockerfile has been provided for arm64 linux development. (Raspberry Pis and alike)

instructions.

## 📡 Installing Profiles

Coming soon, see important notice.

## 🏗️ Building Demos

**ON the device that is to run this code, a computer that is the same OS and architecture, or inside the provided docker container:**

To build demos, start at the root of the repo and execute the following command:
```bash
conan build demos
```

## 💾 Flashing/Programming

The easiest way to get your compiled program onto hardware like a Raspberry Pi is via ssh. (Assuming your hardware's linux installation has sshd).

Run the following command:
```bash
scp path/to/your.bin username@hardware_device:new_path/to/app
```
